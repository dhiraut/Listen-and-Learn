Backend Overview
The backend is responsible for processing text prompts, generating text responses with OpenAI, converting the text to speech, and creating a video file with synchronized subtitles.

Key Files and Functions
index.js: Sets up the Express server and handles routes.
generateAudioFromText: Converts text to .wav audio using the say library.
generateVideoFromTextAndAudio: Uses FFmpeg to create a video with dynamic subtitles.

API Endpoint
POST /api/generate: Accepts a text prompt and returns a generated video file.
Frontend Overview
The frontend is a React application with a user-friendly interface that allows users to enter a text prompt and receive a video response.

Key Features
Responsive Layout: Optimized for various screen sizes.
3D Background: Animated starry background using Three.js.
Dark Mode: Toggle between light and dark themes.

Main Components
App.js: Contains the main interface, form handling, and video display.
Material-UI Styling: Uses custom styles for TextField and Button components.

Usage
Starting the Server
